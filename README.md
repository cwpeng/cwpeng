## Hi, Here is PengPeng

I'm a founder, lecturer with psychological and technical background, especially major in software and web development.

Currently, I focus on two projects mentioned below. Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas I can take part.

### W-Components

W-Components is a front-end library based on Web Components. We look for providing light-weight, well-styled and easy-to-use building units for web development.

Welcome to join us by visiting [W-Components Repository](https://github.com/Padax/w-components) in GitHub.
